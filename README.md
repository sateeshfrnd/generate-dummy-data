This repository demonstrates how to generate dummy or fake data using Python with the Faker library. Faker is a Python package that generates fake data for you.

The faker library in Python is a tool for generating fake data. It's often used in testing, prototyping, and generating dummy data for various purposes. With faker, you can create fake names, addresses, text, numbers, and much more.

## Install offline
To install Python packages offline, including the faker library, you typically need to download the package files (.whl or .tar.gz) along with its dependencies and then install them manually. 


**1. Download the Package Files:**

```
pip install <downloaded_dir>/faker-x.x.x.whl
```

*Replace x.x.x with the version number you downloaded.*
